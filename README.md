ðŸ“š Smart Course Enrollment System (Java + OOP)**  

A **console-based** (or **GUI**) course registration system built with **Java** and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. Designed for students and administrators to manage course enrollment efficiently.  

âœ¨ Key Features**  
âœ” **User Roles:**  
   - **Students** can register, view, and drop courses.  
   - **Admins** can add/remove courses, manage enrollments, and generate reports.  
âœ” **OOP Concepts Applied:**  
   - **Encapsulation** (private fields + getters/setters)  
   - **Inheritance** (User â†’ Student/Admin hierarchy)  
   - **Polymorphism** (method overriding for role-based actions)  
   - **Abstraction** (interfaces/abstract classes for modularity)  
âœ” **Data Persistence:**  
   - Text/CSV files (or **MySQL/Java DB** if applicable) for storing courses, students, and enrollments.  
âœ” **Input Validation & Error Handling** to ensure data integrity.  

ðŸ›  Technologies Used**  
- **Java** (Core + OOP)
